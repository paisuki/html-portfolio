<h1>The Best Movies According to paisuki</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>I Want To Eat Your Pancreas</h3>
<p>This movie really stuck with me even though I watched it on my phone. The movie is too real and does not care about your feelings.</p>

<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>This movie really showed me that people can change if they are genuine. I want to read the manga.</p>

<h3>Josee, the Tiger and the Fish</h3>
<p>This was a pretty uplifting movie that I wanted to watch because e ve had a few banger tracks.</p>
